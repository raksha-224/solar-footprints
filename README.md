# Predicting Solar Installations for Sustainability and Ecological Impact using maching learning models
Data 245 project - Predicting Solar Installations for Sustainability and Ecological Impact
This project aims to predict the type of solar installation (rooftop, parking, or ground-mounted) using machine learning techniques. By utilizing solar footprint data across California, the model helps improve the deployment of solar installations and provides valuable insights for the renewable energy sector.
