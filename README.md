# Predicting Solar Installations for Sustainability and Ecological Impact using maching learning models
Data 245 project - Predicting Solar Installations for Sustainability and Ecological Impact
This project aims to predict the type of solar installation (rooftop, parking, or ground-mounted) using machine learning techniques. By utilizing solar footprint data across California, the model helps improve the deployment of solar installations and provides valuable insights for the renewable energy sector.

Results
The Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) model achieved the highest performance across all metrics with:
Accuracy: 96.67%
Precision: 97%
Recall: 97%
F1 Score: 97%

Acknowledgements
Thanks to the open-source community for the contributions that made this project possible.
Special thanks to the U.S. Government's open data repository (data.gov) for providing the solar installation dataset.
